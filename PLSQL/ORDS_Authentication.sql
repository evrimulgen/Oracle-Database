The client credentials flow is a two-legged process that seems the most natural to me 
as I mostly deal with server-server communication, which should have no human interaction.
For this flow we use the client credentials to return an access token, which is used to authorize calls to protected resources. The example steps through the individual calls, but in reality it would be automated by the application
